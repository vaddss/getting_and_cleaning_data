# Steps on how to implement the script

1. Download and unzip the file in your working directory:
   [Link to data set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
   
   It is the same link as the one provided in the assignment webpage.

2. Download the *run\_analysis.R* file in your working directory and run it in any R command shell or Rstudio session.

3. It should create a csv file called *tidy_data.csv* in your working directory. This is the tidy data set that the assignment required the student to create.
